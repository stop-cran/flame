# Overview

This is a plasma physics simulation project. It involves homogeneous modelling of air-hydrocarbon gas mixture thermodynamics and chemical kinetics. Since the purpose of the project is ignition promotion by the means of gas discharge, electron and some other physical kinetics is included. See [my thesis](http://www.dissercat.com/content/plazmenno-stimulirovannoe-vosplamenenie-vysokoskorostnykh-vozdushno-uglevodorodnykh-potokov-) for more details (in Russian).
